Likewise, the abilities a player character can use are determined by the job they occupy and its current rank, their class, their items, their equipment, and whatever flex powers they have taken during character advancement.

A character's stamina in battle is represented by two scores, their _Hit Points_ and their _Mana Points._  Throughout these rules, these will be shortened to HP and MP, respectively.
